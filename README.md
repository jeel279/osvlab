# Operating System Lab

We have implemented various modules of Disk scheduling algorithms of Operating system from scratch. One can use this for understanding different disk scheduling algorithms and then compare them easily.
Various algorithms implemented here are:
1.	FCFS-First Come First Serve 
2.	SSTF-Shortest Seek Time First 
3.	SCAN-known as Elevator 
4.	CSCAN-Circular SCAN 
5.	LOOK-Advance Version Of SCAN 
6.	CLOOK-Circular Look

## Description

### Deadlock and concurrency with semaphore :

You can visualize and play with the different algorithms of Deadlock and Concurrency.

1. Banker's Algorithm
2. Lock Variable
3. Test & Set Lock
4. Strict Alteration
5. Petersons Algorithm
6. Producer & Consumer
7. Binary Semaphore
8. Counting Semaphore

### Scheduling Algorithm :

You can visualize and play with the all 9 sheduling algorithm on this website.

1. First Come First Serve
2. Shortest Job First
3. Longest Job First
4. Round Robin
5. Shortest Remaining Job First
6. Longest Remaining Job First
7. Priority Preemptive
8. Priority Non-Preemptive
9. Highest Response Ratio Next

## Get started

step 1: Fork repository\
step 2: Clone the Fork repository in your device

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/OS-virtual-lab.git
```

Now you are god to go.
