## Description

We have implemented various modules of Disk scheduling algorithms of Operating system from scratch. One can use this for understanding different disk scheduling algorithms and can experiment some examples. Solutions include graph as well. One can also compare different disk scheduling algorithms with same parameters. 

### Disk scheduling algorithms implemented here are:

You can visualize and play with the all 9 sheduling algorithm on this website.

1.	FCFS  -  First Come First Serve 
2.	SSTF  -  Shortest Seek Time First 
3.	SCAN  -  known as Elevator 
4.	CSCAN -  Circular SCAN 
5.	LOOK  -  Advance Version Of SCAN 
6.	CLOOK -  Circular Look
