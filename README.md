Operating System Project

We have implemented various modules of Disk scheduling algorithms of Operating system from scratch. One can use this for understanding different disk scheduling algorithms and then compare them easily.
Various algorithms implemented here are:
1.	FCFS-First Come First Serve 
2.	SSTF-Shortest Seek Time First 
3.	SCAN-known as Elevator 
4.	CSCAN-Circular SCAN 
5.	LOOK-Advance Version Of SCAN 
6.	CLOOK-Circular Look
